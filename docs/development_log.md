# Development Log

## M0 — Environment and repository initialization

Date: 2026-07-20
Status: complete — awaiting approval for M1

### Preflight

- Repository audit: directory was empty; no Git metadata or user files were present.
- Godot discovery: PATH aliases `godot` and `godot4` were absent; application found at `/Users/USER/Downloads/Godot.app`.
- Confirmed engine: `4.7.1.stable.official.a13da4feb`.
- Confirmed OS: macOS 26.5.2 (Build 25F84).
- Confirmed Git: 2.54.0; repository not initialized at preflight.

### Goals

- Initialize a Godot 4.7.1 project and Git repository.
- Establish the required directory layout and agent conventions.
- Create one dependency-free Main scene that starts safely.
- Document architecture, design baseline, test method, and known issues.

### Planned files

- Root: `project.godot`, `.gitignore`, `README.md`, `AGENTS.md`.
- Scene: `scenes/main/main.tscn`.
- Docs: technical architecture, game design baseline, development log, known issues.
- Placeholder files for required empty directories.

### Test plan

1. Verify exact Godot executable and version.
2. Run `--headless --editor --path . --import --quit` for project import/resource parsing.
3. Run `--headless --path . --quit-after 5` for main-scene startup.
4. Launch the graphical project briefly and capture startup evidence if the environment permits.
5. Review Godot output for errors and warnings and inspect Git status.

### Scope check

M0 contains no player controller, movement, input actions, combat, enemies, levels, checkpoint, or menu behavior. The static Main screen exists only to prove project startup.

### Commands and results

1. `Godot --version`
   - Result: exit 0; `4.7.1.stable.official.a13da4feb`.
2. `sw_vers` and `git --version`
   - Result: macOS 26.5.2 (Build 25F84); Git 2.54.0.
3. `Godot --headless --editor --path . --import --quit`
   - Result: exit 0; filesystem scan and editor initialization completed; no resource or parser errors in output.
4. `Godot --headless --path . --quit-after 5`
   - Result: exit 0; configured Main scene started and stopped without errors.
5. `Godot --path . --write-movie docs/qa/m0_startup.png --fixed-fps 30 --quit-after 3 --audio-driver Dummy --log-file docs/qa/m0_graphical_run.log`
   - Result: exit 0; OpenGL Compatibility renderer initialized on Apple M4 and wrote three 1280×720 frames.
   - Reviewed evidence: `docs/qa/m0_startup00000002.png`; the title, Chinese subtitle, procedural moon/spires, and M0 status are visible and correctly laid out.
6. `git status --short --branch`
   - Result: repository contents reviewed before the milestone commit; `.godot/` is correctly ignored.

No scripts exist in M0, so script-unit tests and GDScript static analysis have no applicable targets yet.

### Delivered

- Godot project configuration with `scenes/main/main.tscn` as the main scene.
- Required scene, script, resource, asset, test, documentation, and add-on directories.
- Repository/agent conventions, technical architecture, design baseline, known-issue log, and visual QA evidence.
- Main scene uses only Godot native nodes and procedural polygons; no third-party assets were introduced.

### Manual acceptance

1. Open the project with Godot 4.7.1 Standard.
2. Press `F5` and confirm a 1280×720 window opens.
3. Confirm `NOCTURNE KEEP`, `夜幕古堡`, and `M0 · PROJECT INITIALIZED` are visible.
4. Stop the project and confirm the editor Output/Debugger shows no error.

### M0 tuning changes

None. Gameplay values were not implemented or altered in this milestone.
